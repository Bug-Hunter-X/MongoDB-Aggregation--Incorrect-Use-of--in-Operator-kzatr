# MongoDB Aggregation: Incorrect Use of $in Operator

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$in` operator within MongoDB aggregation pipelines.  The example showcases an incorrect implementation that leads to unexpected behavior, along with a corrected version.

## Problem
The provided `bug.js` file contains code that incorrectly uses the `$in` operator. The `$in` operator is intended to match documents where a field's value is present within a specified array of values. However, the example code might misuse this operator, resulting in incorrect query results.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file offers the correct implementation of the `$in` operator. This corrected version accurately filters documents based on the values in the provided array. 

This example highlights the importance of paying close attention to the expected input types and usage when working with MongoDB aggregation operators. Incorrect usage can lead to unexpected results and debugging challenges.
